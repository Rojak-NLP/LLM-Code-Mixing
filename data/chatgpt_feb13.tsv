I hope the government can do something to ease the traffic.  Speaker 2: Oo nga, kailangan talaga ng malawakang solusyon. Mas maganda kung may mas maraming public transportation options. Translation: Yes, a comprehensive solution is really needed. It would be better if there were more public transportation options.  Speaker 1: Tama ka diyan. Pero sana rin may magawa rin para sa mga motorista tulad ko. Hindi biro ang trapik na nakakapagod at nakakastress. Translation: You're right about that. But I hope they can also do something for motorists like me. Traffic is not easy, it's tiring and stressful.  Speaker 2: Oo nga, kailangan talaga ng balance. Pero hindi natin pwedeng asahan na bigla na lang magbabago ang sitwasyon. Translation: That's right, we really need balance. But we can't expect the situation to change suddenly.  Speaker 1: Sana nga may magawa man lang para mabawasan ang oras ng byahe. Mas mahalaga yun kaysa sa maluwag na daan. Translation: I hope they can do something to reduce travel time. That's more important than having wider roads.  Speaker 2: Tama ka diyan. Kailangan natin ng mas praktikal na solusyon sa trapik. Translation: You're right about that. We need a more practical solution for traffic.	0		0		Tagalog	Feb 13	Grabe ang traffic kanina sa EDSA, no? Oo nga, sobrang tindi ng trapik. Anong oras ka dumaan?
